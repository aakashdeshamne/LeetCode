Problem: Maximizing Product of Sum of K Positive Integers

Algorithm: Optimal Integer Splitting

Input:

An integer n.
Output:

Maximum product of the sum of k positive integers.
Procedure:

a. If n is 2, return 1.

b. Initialize result to 1.

c. If n is divisible by 3, use all 3s until n becomes 0.

d. If n is 1 more than a multiple of 3, use one 4 and the rest 3s.

e. If n is 2 more than a multiple of 3, use two 2s and the rest 3s.

f. Return the result.

Algorithm Explanation:

This algorithm optimally breaks down the integer n into the sum of k positive integers to maximize their product. It employs a strategy of using factors such as 3, 4, and 2 to achieve the desired result.

Example Usage:

For n = 2, the output is 1.
For n = 10, the output is 36.
